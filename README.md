## Project Overview
Designed for full automation, idempotency, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), this project ensures consistent, efficient, and reliable operations. It automates daily weather data collection, aggregation, and notifications using AWS services and Ansible. The project fetches weather data for four cities, uploads it to S3, triggers a Lambda function via EventBridge, and sends an aggregated report through SNS.

## Components

- **Rocky Linux VM**: Provides a RHEL-based and stable environment for Ansible and script execution
- **Ansible**: Automates the deployment of AWS infrastructure and project setup
- **Python:** Facilitates weather data fetching, aggregation, and automation through custom scripts:
  - Fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API
  - Uploads aggregated data to S3
  - Processes S3 events and sends notifications to SNS
- **AWS Services**:
  - **S3**: Stores object weather data
  - **SNS**: Manage notifications through topics and subscribers
  - **Lambda**: Processes S3 events and publishes reports to SNS
  - **EventBridge**: Using event pattern rule to detect S3 object creation and trigger the Lambda function
  - **IAM**: Manages secure access to AWS services with fine-grained policies and roles
- **Cron**: Schedules the Python script to run daily for consistent weather data collection
- **Email**: Delivers weather reports to end users via notifications sent through AWS SNS
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides real-time weather data for multiple cities

  - Allocate sufficient resources: **2 CPUs, 4GB RAM**
- **OpenWeather API**
  - A free registered account with provided API key 
- **AWS Account**
   - An AWS account with provisioned access-key and secret-key

## Environment Setup

**Run the following to setup our VM:**
```bash
cd
dnf install -y git ansible-core
git clone -b feature/sns-eventbridge https://github.com/Thuynh808/weather-dashboard-automation
cd weather-dashboard
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yaml -vv
```
  Command Breakdown:
  - Navigates to home directory
  - Installs `Git` and `Ansible`
  - Clone repository
  - Navigates to project directory
  - Install required Ansible Collections

## Define Variables

**Update variables with proper values for files: `myvars.yaml` and `.env`**
```bash
vim myvars.yaml
```
```bash
accesskeyid: "<your-access-key-id>"
secretaccesskey: "<your-secret-access-key>"
defaultregion: "us-east-1"
emailendpoint: "<your-email>"
bucketname: "<your-bucket-name>"
```
```bash
vim .env
```
```bash
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket-name>
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```
**Set permissions to secure files**
```bash
chmod 0600 .env myvars.yaml 
```
> Note: Keep these sensitive files local. Add to `.gitignore` if uploading to GitHub
<br>  

## Deployment and Testing

**Run Playbook:**
```bash
ansible-playbook weather_env_s3_sns.yaml -vv
```
  The `weather_env_s3_sns.yaml` playbook will:
  - Install and upgrade system packages
  - Install `pip` modules with required versions
  - Download, unzip and install `AWS CLI`
  - Configure `AWS CLI`
  - Create S3 bucket
  - Create SNS topic to send notifications to email subscriber
  - Append SNS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to `myvars.yaml` file

**Confirm Successful Execution:**
```bash
rpm -qa curl unzip python3 python3-pip
pip list | egrep "boto3|botocore|python-dotenv|requests" 
aws configure list
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws s3 ls
aws sns list-topics
```

  - **System dependencies**: (curl, unzip, python3, python3-pip) are installed
  - **Python libraries**: (boto3, botocore, python-dotenv, requests) are installed with required versions
  - **AWS CLI**: credentials and region are properly configured
  - **IAM identity**: is correctly authenticated via AWS CLI, confirming access to the AWS account
  - **S3 bucket**: exists and is accessible through the CLI
  - **SNS topic**: is successfully created, and its ARN matches the expected configuration

**Run Final Playbook:**
```bash
ansible-playbook weather_lambda_eventbridge.yaml -vv
```
  The `weather_lambda_eventbridge.yaml` playbook will:
  - Create IAM `lambda-execution-role` to provide permissions to execute `Lambda` function
  - Add IAM execution role ARN variable to myvars.yaml
  - Generate a custom IAM policy and attach to our `lambda-execution-role`
  - Compress the `Lambda` python script
  - Create `Lambda` function from script and attach the IAM role
  - Append `Lambda` variables to myvars.yaml
  - Enable `EventBridge` notifications on `S3` bucket
  - Generate rule in `EventBridge` for newly created objects in `S3`
  - Set `EventBridge` target to invoke the `Lambda` function when event is triggered
  - Automate a daily cron job to fetch weather data and upload it to `S3` using a Python script

**Confirm Successful Execution:**

```bash
aws lambda list-functions
aws events list-rules 
crontab -l
```
<details close>

  - **Lambda Function**: Verify function name and ARN are correct; SNS Topic ARN is properly set as environment variable
  - **EventBridge Rule**: Confirm state is `ENABLED` and event pattern is set to trigger when an object is created in S3
  - **Cron Job**: a daily cron job exists to run the Python script (weather_data_aggregator.py) at the correct time (0 8 * * *)
  </details>

### Excellent! Now for a demo, let's manually test our Weather Dashboard!

**Run:**
```bash
python src/weather_data_aggregator.py
```
<details close>
  <summary> <h4>See results</h4> </summary>

**Awesome! We can confirm the data is saved to S3 which triggered our workflow to finally deliver the notification to our email!**

## Challenges and Solutions

- Versioning Issue with Lambda ARN: Resolved by dynamically extracting the base ARN without version numbers
- Policy Propagation Error: Added a "pause" module after creating IAM policies to ensure EventBridge permissions were applied
- Dynamic Variables in Ansible: Used set_fact and lineinfile modules to dynamically update variable file
- Conditional Task Execution: Ensured the AWS CLI installation only runs when not already present using "when" conditions
- S3 Event Configuration Error: Properly enabled EventBridge for S3 bucket events to trigger Lambda

## Conclusion

Let's GO!! I thoroughly enjoyed building the Weather-Dashboard-Automation project. I've gained more hands-on experience with AWS services along with Ansible automation and IaC principles. To see these services work seamlessly to create a functional, scalable solution for daily weather notifications was such a thrill!
